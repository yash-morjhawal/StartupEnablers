    <h1>Cheat Sheet for FDI in Single Brand Retail Trading</h1>
</header>
<main>
    <p>India’s Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) policy in Single Brand Retail Trading (SBRT) has undergone significant changes, making it easier for global brands to enter the market while ensuring local economic benefits.</p>

    <h2>FDI Limits & Approval Process</h2>
    <p>100% FDI is permitted in SBRT under the automatic route (since Jan 2018), eliminating the need for government approval. Earlier, approval was required for FDI beyond 49%.</p>

    <h2>Local Sourcing Requirement (30% Mandate)</h2>
    <p>If FDI exceeds 51%, at least 30% of the goods’ value must be sourced from India, with some portion from MSMEs, village and cottage industries, artisans, and craftsmen.</p>
    <p>For the first 5 years, global sourcing from India can count toward this requirement; afterward, it applies solely to Indian operations.</p>

    <h2>E-Commerce & Physical Store Requirement</h2>
    <p>Retailers can sell online but must set up a physical store within two years of starting online sales. Products must be sold under a single brand, globally registered.</p>

    <h2>Impact of Liberalization</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Boosts consumer choices</li>
        <li>Encourages local manufacturing</li>
        <li>Creates jobs</li>
        <li>Strengthens supply chains</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Balancing local sourcing with quality</li>
        <li>Regulatory navigation</li>
        <li>Competition from domestic & e-commerce players</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> India’s SBRT FDI policy offers huge potential, but requires careful compliance and sourcing strategy for success.</p>
