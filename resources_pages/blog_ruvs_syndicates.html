    <h1>Roll Up Vehicles (RUVs) and Syndicates: Reshaping Startup Investments in India</h1>
</header>
<main>
    <h2>Understanding RUVs</h2>
    <p>RUVs consolidate investments from multiple angels into a single entity, simplifying cap tables for startups and easing investor management.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Syndicates</h2>
    <p>Led by an experienced investor who finds deals, negotiates terms, and presents them to members who can opt in. Platforms like AngelList and LetsVenture facilitate these models.</p>

    <h2>Regulatory Challenges</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>SEBI Angel Fund minimum INR 25 lakh investment</li>
        <li>Qualified investor criteria</li>
        <li>1-year holding period</li>
        <li>Max 25% of corpus in one startup</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Future</h2>
    <p>With over 125 syndicates in India, expected to cross 200 by 2030, these models will continue growing as SEBI refines regulations.</p>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> RUVs and Syndicates streamline early-stage funding while protecting investors. Both founders and investors must understand compliance to leverage these models effectively.</p>
