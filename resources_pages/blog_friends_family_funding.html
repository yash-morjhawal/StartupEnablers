    <h1>Raising Funds from Friends and Family (F&F) â€“ Early-Stage Startups</h1>
</header>
<main>
    <p>Raising funds from friends and family is a common early-stage startup strategy. While informal, it must comply with legal frameworks under Indian corporate law.</p>

    <h2>Valuation Reports</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Required under Companies Act, 2013 for private placement.</li>
        <li>For non-residents, FEMA compliance requires SEBI-registered Merchant Banker or CA valuation.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Secretarial Compliance</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Form SH-7:</strong> For increasing authorized share capital.</li>
        <li><strong>MGT-14:</strong> Filed with RoC when private placement is approved.</li>
        <li><strong>PAS-4:</strong> Offer Letter for private placement.</li>
        <li><strong>PAS-3:</strong> Filed after allotment of shares; funds cannot be used before filing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Investment Agreements</h2>
    <p>Even with friends/family, have a formal agreement covering:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Nature of investment</li>
        <li>Equity distribution</li>
        <li>Voting rights</li>
        <li>Exit mechanisms</li>
        <li>Dispute resolution</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Friends and family funding can be valuable, but must be legally compliant to protect both founders and investors.</p>
